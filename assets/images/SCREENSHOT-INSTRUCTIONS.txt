SCREENSHOT INSTRUCTIONS
=======================

WordPress themes need a screenshot.png file in the theme root folder.

Requirements:
- Filename: screenshot.png
- Dimensions: 1200 x 900 pixels
- Format: PNG

How to create:
1. Install and activate the theme on a test WordPress site
2. Visit the homepage
3. Take a full-page screenshot
4. Crop/resize to 1200x900 pixels
5. Save as screenshot.png in the theme root folder

The screenshot appears in:
- Appearance > Themes (theme preview)
- Theme selection dialogs

Tip: Capture the homepage showing the hero banner, welcome section,
and partial sidebar to give a good representation of the theme's look.
